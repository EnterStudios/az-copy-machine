## What is it? 

A Chrome extension to allow stories to be copied and moved across AgileZen projects.

![Toolbar buttons](docs/images/screen_toolbar.png)

On story detail pages, Copy and Move buttons are injected into the page. Copying a ticket will clone it, while moving it will clone it and delete the original. Stories can be copied/moved to the same or another project, as well as optionally copying the tags and tasks.
